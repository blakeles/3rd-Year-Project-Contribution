# 3rd-Year-Project-Contribution
My contribution to my 3rd year group project.

This was code I contirbuted to for my final year group project. I worked within the sensors / environment section of the ERD and system diagrams which cover the entire project.
Not all of the code in this repository is mine. I worked with a group of 4 other people and there were contributions to each other's sections when required.

The brief for this project was to create a smart environment system that used MicroBits to track and manage rooms and people. I worked on the code for the MicroBits themselves.
